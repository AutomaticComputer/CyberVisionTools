## Decompose Cassette

"cybervision_decompose_cassette.py"
decomposes a wav file into an audio track (if any), a series of text files and a configuration file. 


### Usage

```
python cybervision_decompose_cassette.py [-i] (basename)
```

This reads ```(basename).wav``` and outputs a number of files. 
With "-i" option, the phase is inverted. 

If the wav file is stereo (i.e. has 2 channels), 
the left track is output as ```(basename)_audio.wav```.

From the data track, each continuous block of bits is written as 
```(basename)_nnn.txt```, where nnn is the serial number starting with 000. 
This is a text file expressing the bits with `0` and `1`. 

Finally, a text file ```(basename)_out.cfg``` is generated, 
which contains the information of the cassette and can be used as an input for 
cybervision_compose_cassette.py. 
See [Configuration file](#configuration-file) for the format of this file. 

A warning is given if the gap between blocks is too short 
(which might mean that the data was corrupt). 

If the script gives many warnings or incorrect output, it might be because... 
- The threshold for amplitude is too high or low. 
Change "amplitude_threshold = 0.02" to an appropriate value. 
- The phase is inverted. Use "-i" option. 


## Compose Cassette

"cybervision_compose_cassette.py" creates a wav file to be used with CyberVision. 
Caution: this is SLOW. 

### Usage

```
python cybervision_compose_cassette.py (basename)
```

Reads the configuration file ```(basename).cfg``` and create ```(basename)_out.wav``` 
according to the configuration file. 



## Configuration file

Each line of a configuration file is a command. 
In each line, anything after the first 2 words are ignored. 

```
C (n)
F (n)
W (n)
```

Set the number of channels, framerate, or sample width to ```(n)``` (an integer).
These should be used only once at the beginning. 


```
A (filename)
```

Use ```(filename)``` as the audio track. 
This should be used only once at the beginning. 
The number of channels, framerate, and sample width are overridden. 

```
T (x)
```

Skip to time ```(x)``` (a floating point number, in seconds). 

```
S (filename)
```

Write serial data from ```(filename)```. 
In ```(basename).txt```, anything other than '0' and '1' are ignored. 

In the output from cybervision_decompose_cassette.py, 
the third word is the time where the block ends. 

```
B (filename)
```

Write binary data from ```(filename)```. 
A start bit (1) and a stop bit (0) are added at the beginning and the end of each byte. 


## Serial2bin

### Usage

```
python cybervision_serial2bin.py (basename)
```

Reads the text file ```(basename).txt``` as a serial bitstream, with start bit 1 and stop bit 0, 
and writes the binary to ```(basename).bin```. 
Another output is a text file ```(basename)_split.txt```, 
which is given by adding a newline before each start bit. 



## Recovering data

If cybervision_decompose_cassette.py could not read the data correctly, 
it is often because of level drops. 
Then, typically, the script gives warnings. 

Locating this by an application like Audacity, 
reading the correct value and fixing the ''serial file'' manually 
(```*_split.txt``` from cybervision_serial2bin.py might help) 
and editing cfg file, 
it is sometimes possible to fix the data. 


## A sample program

A "Hello" program is in example directory. 
(I am not very sure about what should be in header.txt, but this works.)

Voiceover was generated by Micmonster.
